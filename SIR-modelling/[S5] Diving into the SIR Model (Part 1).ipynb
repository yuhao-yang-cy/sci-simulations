    "The spread of an infectious disease may be modelled by the so-called SIR equations:\n",

    "\\end{aligned}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$, $I$, $R$ represents the size of the susceptible, infective and recovered population. The parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ shown up in the equations are known as the infection rate and the recovery rate respectively, which describe the probabilty per unit time that an individual could get infected by the disease or a patient could get recovered from the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of dimensionless parameters:\n",

    "## Basic Reproduction Ratio $\\mathcal{R}_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned, the key factor that determines whether an infective disease would develop into a widely-spread epidemic in the SIR model is the basic reproduction ratio $\\mathcal{R}_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see why is that, we can first think about the basic reproduction ratio as the expected number of innocent people that will be eventually affected by the first infective individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the first infected individual $X$ for convenience. Suppose $X$ gets the disease at $t=0$. Let $l(t)$ be the probability such that $X$ is still infective to the susceptible at time $t$. In the time interval from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$, there is a probablity of $\\gamma \\Delta t$ that $X$ might get recovered, or put it differently, the probability that $X$ remains infective during the interval is $1-\\gamma \\Delta t$. So we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "l(t+\\Delta t) &= l(t) + \\Delta l = l(t) (1-\\gamma \\Delta t) \\\\\n",
    "\\Delta l &= -\\gamma l(t)\\Delta t\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\Delta t \\to 0$, this becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} l}{\\mathrm{d} t} = -\\gamma l$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution for $l(t)$ is not hard to find. Normal routine for solving first-order differential equations will do, simply separate the variables and integrate. With the initial condition $l(0) = 1$ (as we are looking at this number one infective case), then one finds\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ l(t) = \\mathrm{e}^{-\\gamma t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How many other individuals will this guy $X$ infect? If someone is to get infected at some time within $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$, then $X$ must still be infective during this interval, also the unlucky guy needs to make contact with $X$ and gets the disease, so for every singe susceptible individual, the probablity of getting infected in $\\Delta t$ is $l(t) \\times \\beta \\Delta t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this potential epidemics, everybody belongs to the susceptible group apart from the first infected person $X$, so we take the initial susceptible population $S$ to be the entire population $N$. During time $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$, the expected number of new cases is $N\\times l(t) \\times \\beta \\Delta t$. Integrating over time, we find the expected number of all transmission cases directly related to this first infective person $X$ to be:\n",

    "## Condition for an Epidemic\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the **fixed points** for the SIR equations: $(\\hat{S}_*, \\hat{I}_*, \\hat{R}_*)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are the fixed points? Suppose the system is set off from the fixed points, then there will be no ongoing change afterwards, i.e., all the variables will stay fixed. To find the fixed points, we require all those first derivative terms vanish. So for the SIR equations, we set $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\hat{S}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\hat{I}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\hat{R}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau} = 0$. \n",

    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "- \\mathcal{R}_0 \\hat{S}_* \\hat{I}_* & =0\\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{R}_0 \\hat{S}_* \\hat{I}_* - \\hat{I}_* & =0\\\\\n",
    "\\hat{I}_* & =0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\hat{R}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau} = 0$ immediately tells us $\\hat{I}_*=0$, then $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\hat{S}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\hat{I}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau} = 0$ hold automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not hard to understand why $\\hat{I}_*=0$ is a fixed point. If there is no infective individual in the entire population, then the susceptible will never get exposed to the disease, and surely the recovered would stay healthy happily ever after, then the size of each group stays constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\hat{S} + \\hat{I} + \\hat{R} = 1$, or $\\hat{R}_* = 1 - \\hat{S}_*$, then this shows we can represent the fixed point with one parameter only:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (\\hat{S}_*, \\hat{I}_*, \\hat{R}_*) = (\\hat{S}_*, 0, 1-\\hat{S}_*)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's then explore the stability of the fixed point. What if a small number of people somehow get infective? Does the number of cases grow or decrease? Or in the language of differental equation theories, does the evolution of the system gets pushed away from the fixed point, or does it gets pulled back towards the fixed point?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the equation for $\\hat{I}$ near the fixed point is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\hat{I}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau} = (\\mathcal{R}_0 \\hat{S}_* - 1) \\hat{I} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\mathcal{R}_0 \\hat{S}_* - 1 >0$，then the size of the infective population $\\hat{I}$ will start to grow exponentially. This means $\\hat{I}_*=0$ is unstable, the disease will spread. Therefore, a necessary condition for a disease to spread to become an epidemic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{R}_0 \\hat{S}_* > 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new virus shows up, the number of infective is only a tiny fraction of the entire population, so $\\hat{I}_0 \\approx 0$. At the mean time, any other individual is an susceptible, so $\\hat{S}_0 \\approx 1$，while there is no person recovered and gets immunity from the disease, so $\\hat{R}_0 = 0$. With these in mind, the condition for the virus to spread can be further simplified to be $\\mathcal{R}_0 > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you might argue that those virus like Covid-19 are able to affect us for a second time even if we have been infected before or vaccined. In such cases, there is no recovered group in the model and everybody is susceptible. This simple model is called the SIS model, also an important basic model in the study of infectious disease. Taking $\\hat{S}_* \\approx 1$, again we find the condition for the disease to spread in the SIS model is $\\mathcal{R}_0 > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either models, we have such an elegant equation telling us such an important thing: when does an epidemic outbreak occur? It is worthwhile to write this condition one more time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\color{blue}{\\mathcal{R}_0 > 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason behind this is also easy to explain. If an individual infected person can pass the virus to more than one other individuals, then the chain of transmission will grow like a snowball. Even if the number of infected cases is kept low at some point, but as long as new cases occur, they have the potential to develop into a large-scale epidemics. "
